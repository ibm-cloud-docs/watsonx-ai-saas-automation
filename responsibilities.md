# Understanding your responsibilities when you use _deployable-architecture-name_
{: #your-id}

<!-- The title of your H1 should be Understanding your responsibilities when you use _deployable-architecture-name_, where _deployable-architecture-name_ is the non-trademarked short version name of your deployable architecture. -->

Learn about the management responsibilities and terms and conditions that you have when you use the _deployable-architecture-name_ deployable architecture.
{: shortdesc}

- For more information about the responsibilities for you and for {{site.data.keyword.IBM}} when you use a deployable architecture, see [Understanding your responsibilities when you use deployable architectures](/docs/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-responsibilities-deployable-architectures).
- For a high-level view of the service types in {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} and the breakdown of responsibilities between the customer and {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} for each type, see [Shared responsibilities for using {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} products](/docs/overview?topic=overview-shared-responsibilities).
- For the overall terms of use, see [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Terms and Notices](/docs/overview/terms-of-use?topic=overview-terms).

<!-- If you have additional responsibilities for you deployable architecture beyond what is covered in the overall "Understanding your responsibilities when you use deployable architectures" topic, include the next paragraph and group your items in the provided sections. If you don't, delete from here down. -->

Review the following sections for the specific responsibilities for you and for {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} when you use the _deployable-architecture-name_ deployable architecture.

<!-- If you plan to list resource responsibility (see resources listed in each table in the platform shared responsibilities topic linked earlier) instead of individual tasks, you do not need to include rows for Hypervisor, Physical Servers and memory, Physical storage, Physical network and devices, and Facilities and data centers unless you need to indicate a 'Shared' or 'Customer' responsibility for one of the areas within those resources. -->

<!-- In the following sections, add tasks that are specific to your deployable architecture. Do not add tasks that are covered in the "Understanding your responsibilities when you use deployable architectures" that you link to earlier -->
