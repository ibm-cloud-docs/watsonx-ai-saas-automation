# Getting help and support for watsonx AI SaaS
{: #help-and-support}

If you experience an issue or have questions when deploying watsonx AI SaaS, you can use the following resources before you open a support case.
{: shortdesc}

* Review the [FAQs](/docs/watsonx-ai-saas-automation?topic=watsonx-ai-saas-automation-faqs) in the deployment guide.
* Review the [troubleshooting documentation](/docs/watsonx-ai-saas-automation?topic=watsonx-ai-saas-automation-ts-na-failures) to troubleshoot and resolve common issues.
* ![{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} icon](../icons/ibm-cloud-16.svg "IBM Cloud icon") Check the status of the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} platform and resources by going to the [Status page](https://cloud.ibm.com/status){: external}.
* ![GitHub icon](../icons/logo-github-16.svg "GitHub icon") Review the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/terraform-ibm-modules/terraform-ibm-watsonx-saas-da/issues){: external} to see whether other users experienced the same problem.

If you still can't resolve the problem, you can open a support case. For more information, see [Creating support cases](/docs/get-support?topic=get-support-open-case). And, if you're looking to provide feedback, see [Submitting feedback](/docs/overview?topic=overview-feedback).

## Providing support case details
{: #support-case-details}

To ensure that the support team can start investigating your case to provide a timely resolution, you must include in the support case the Terraform Log Analyzer summary from your project:

1. In the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, go to **your project** > **Configurations** > **deployable architecture instance**.
2. Depending on where you are in your deployment process go to **Viewing validation results** or **Viewing last deployment**. Expand all sections, take a screenshot of the results, and add it to your support case.
3. Select the **failed operation (plan or deployment)** > **Logs**. Then, copy and paste the logs and add them to your support case.

## Routing your support case
{: #support-case-routing}

To get your support case routed correctly to speed up a resolution, make sure that you select the correct product when you open the case. If you're having issues getting the deployable architecture deployed, use the name of the deployable architecture as it is listed in the catalog.

However, if you successfully deployed and are having an issue with a service in the deployable architecture, set that service as the product name in the case.
